<h2> The interaction</h2>

<p>In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. </p>
<p>Each participant in the group is given {{ Constants.endowment }}. </p>
<p>Each participant in the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to a common project.</p>
<p>Contributions could be any integer between 0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}.</p>

<h2> Your payoff </h2>
<p> The earnings from the project are calculated as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
  The contributions of all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants are added up.</li>
  <li>
    The sum of contributions is multiplied by a factor of {{ Constants.multiplier }}: these are the <i>total returns from the project</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Total returns from the project</i> are then evenly split among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }}  participants: : these are <i>your earnings from the project</i>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Your payoff</i> is given by your earnings from the project, plus the amount you did not contribute.</p>
